.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pyspread
is a non-traditional spreadsheet application that is based on and written in the
programming language Python.
The goal of pyspread is to be the most pythonic spreadsheet.
Pyspread expects Python expressions in its grid cells, which makes a spreadsheet
specific language obsolete. Each cell returns a Python object that can be accessed
from other cells. These objects can represent anything including lists or matrices.
