<h1>About</h1>

<p class="one_line_heading">
  Pyspread is a non-traditional spreadsheet application that is based on and
  written in the programming language
  <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>.
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
  The goal of pyspread is to be the most pythonic spreadsheet.
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
  Pyspread expects Python expressions in its grid cells, which makes a
  spreadsheet specific language obsolete. Each cell returns a Python object that
  can be accessed from other cells. These objects can represent anything
  including lists or matrices.
</p>
<p class="one_line_heading">
  Pyspread is free software. It is released under the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL v3</a>.
</p>

<h1>Features</h1>

<ul class="one_line_heading">
  <li>CSV import and export</li>
  <li>Chart creation dialog based on <a
      href="http://matplotlib.org/"> matplotlib</a> </li>
  <li>Python objects as cell results</li>
  <li>Python macros</li>
  <li>GPG based save file signatures for preventing foreign
    code execution<br>
  </li>
  <li>Access to all Python modules from within cells. These
    modules allow for example matrix operations via <a
      href="http://www.numpy.org/"> numpy</a> or fixed point
    decimal numbers for business calculations via <a
      href="http://docs.python.org/library/decimal.html">
      decimal</a>.
  </li>
</ul>


<h1>Target group</h1>

<p class="one_line_heading">
  Directly using Python code in a grid is a core feature of pyspread.
  The target user group has experience with or wants to learn the
  programming language Python:
</p>

<ul class="one_line_heading">
    <li>Peter regularly documents layout planning projects. He already has
        a large base of Python code for doing calculations in
        this task. Peter has to provide project documentation in pdf files
        with a consistant layout. In the documentation, he has to visualize
        building layouts and calculation charts.
    <li>Clara is a research engineer and wants to quickly create presentations
        and posters with a consistent layout and publication ready figures for
        her publications.
        She is proficient with Python and uses it for her scientific analyses.
</ul>

<p class="one_line_heading">
  Not part of the target user group of Dolphin are Donna and Jack:
</p>

<ul class="one_line_heading">
    <li>Donna is looking for a free replacement for Ms. Excel.
        She does not know any programming language.
    <li>Jack does computation intensive data analysis that may take hours
        to compute. He is looking for a visually interactive data mining
        tool.
</ul>

<p class="one_line_heading">
  This does not mean that Donna or Jack cannot work with pyspread. However,
  Donna might find the larning curve for using Python code in cells too steep.
  Jack on the other hand might be disappointed because his long running tasks
  are likely to lock up pyspread.
